There is a ton of trails, so go to any of the&lt;br /&gt;10 bike shops and get them to hook you up with a trail map and point where and &lt;br /&gt;how you get to Shultz Creek.",

      "description": "Great trail, once  you get there. I bit off just a bit too much for my self . 25 miles to be exact. It's a network of trails to get there but once you do the actual Shultz<br />trail is about 6-8 miles of smooth downhill, with great views of the mountains.<br />",
